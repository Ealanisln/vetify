## 🟠 PENDING - Deployment Preparation

### Database Configuration

- [ ] **Configure connection pooling** for production
  ```env
  DATABASE_URL="postgresql://...?connection_limit=10&pool_timeout=20"
  ```
  Current: Using Supabase which handles connection pooling automatically

- [ ] **Set up Supabase environment variables**
  - [ ] `DATABASE_URL` - Pooled connection string
  - [ ] `DIRECT_URL` - Direct connection string for migrations
  - [ ] `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Service role key for RLS bypass
  - [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Public Supabase URL
  - [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Anonymous key for client

### Environment Setup

- [ ] **Update production environment variables** in Vercel
  - [ ] Kinde Auth credentials
  - [ ] Stripe API keys (test and live)
  - [ ] Supabase credentials
  - [ ] Upstash Redis credentials
  - [ ] Sentry credentials (optional)

### Database Migration

- [ ] **Choose migration path** (see `docs/CRITICAL_FIXES_COMPLETE.md`)
  - [ ] Path A: Manual SQL migration (recommended for production)
  - [ ] Path B: Prisma migrate dev (development only)
  - [ ] Path C: Prisma migrate diff (advanced)

- [ ] **Full database backup** before migration
  ```bash
  # For Supabase, use their built-in backup or:
  pg_dump -Fc $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).dump
  ```

- [ ] **Apply migration to staging/development** first
  ```bash
  # Option 1: Using provided SQL migration
  psql $DATABASE_URL < docs/migrations/critical_fixes.sql

  # Option 2: Using Prisma
  pnpm prisma migrate deploy
  ```

- [ ] **Verify migration success**
  ```bash
  pnpm prisma validate
  pnpm prisma generate
  pnpm test
  ```

## 🟡 OPTIONAL - Code Optimization

### Code Optimization (Optional Performance Improvements)

- [ ] **Reduce over-fetching** in queries
  - [ ] Use `select` instead of `include` where possible
  - [ ] Review dashboard queries for unnecessary relations
  - [ ] Review customer queries for deep nesting
  - [ ] Review admin queries for excessive includes

- [ ] **Implement cursor pagination** for large lists
  - [ ] Sales list
  - [ ] Customer list
  - [ ] Appointment calendar

- [ ] **Add explicit relation names** for clarity (low priority)
  ```prisma
  user User? @relation("CustomerUser", fields: [userId], references: [id])
  ```

### Database Maintenance (Recommended for Long-term)

- [ ] **Set up monitoring** in Supabase dashboard
  - [ ] Review slow queries regularly
  - [ ] Monitor index usage
  - [ ] Track connection pool usage
  - [ ] Set up alerts for errors

- [ ] **Add CHECK constraints** for additional data validation
  - [ ] Sale totals >= 0
  - [ ] Inventory quantities >= 0
  - [ ] Appointment duration 5-480 minutes
  - [ ] Tax rate 0-100%

## 🟢 OPTIONAL - Nice to Have

### Documentation Enhancements

- [ ] **Add database comments** for tables and columns
  ```sql
  COMMENT ON TABLE "Customer" IS 'Pet owners and clients';
  COMMENT ON COLUMN "Customer"."source" IS 'MANUAL, PUBLIC_BOOKING, IMPORT';
  ```

- [ ] **Document custom database functions**
  - [x] `user_tenant_id()` - RLS function ✅
  - [ ] Any additional custom functions

### Advanced Features

- [x] **Row-Level Security (RLS)** for tenant isolation ✅ COMPLETE
- [ ] **Read replicas** for reporting queries (Supabase Enterprise)
- [ ] **Database encryption** for sensitive fields (consider field-level encryption)
- [ ] **Point-in-time recovery** configuration (Supabase provides this)

---

## Validation Steps

### 1. Schema Validation ✅

```bash
# Validate Prisma schema
pnpm prisma validate

# Check migration status
pnpm prisma migrate status

# Generate Prisma Client
pnpm prisma generate
```

**Expected**: All commands should complete without errors

### 2. RLS Validation

```bash
# Run comprehensive RLS test suite
pnpm rls:test
```

**Expected**: All 10 tests passing

### 3. Database Health Check (Supabase SQL Editor)

```sql
-- Verify no orphaned records (should return 0)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Pet" p
LEFT JOIN "Customer" c ON p."customerId" = c.id
WHERE c.id IS NULL;

-- Check RLS is enabled on tenant-scoped tables
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND tablename IN ('Pet', 'Customer', 'Appointment', 'Sale');

-- Verify composite indexes exist
SELECT tablename, indexname
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND indexname LIKE '%tenantId%'
ORDER BY tablename;
```

### 4. Application Testing - CRUD Operations

Test these operations through the Next.js app:

- [ ] **Create operations**
  - [ ] Create customer → Success
  - [ ] Add pet to customer → Success
  - [ ] Schedule appointment → Success
  - [ ] Process sale → Success
  - [ ] Add inventory item → Success

- [ ] **Read operations**
  - [ ] View customer list → Only tenant's customers visible
  - [ ] View pet list → Only tenant's pets visible
  - [ ] View appointment calendar → Only tenant's appointments visible
  - [ ] View sales reports → Only tenant's sales visible

- [ ] **Update operations**
  - [ ] Edit customer details → Success
  - [ ] Update pet information → Success
  - [ ] Modify appointment → Success
  - [ ] Adjust inventory → Success

- [ ] **Delete operations**
  - [ ] Delete customer → Pets deleted, appointments/sales nullified → Success
  - [ ] Delete inventory item → Sales history preserved → Success
  - [ ] Delete user → Cash drawers remain → Success

### 5. Multi-Tenant Isolation Testing

- [ ] Create two test tenants
- [ ] Add data to each tenant
- [ ] Log in as user from tenant 1
- [ ] Verify: Only see tenant 1's data
- [ ] Log in as user from tenant 2
- [ ] Verify: Only see tenant 2's data

### 6. Performance Testing (Optional)

```bash
# Test key endpoints with realistic load
# Note: Replace URLs with your actual deployment URL

# Customer list endpoint
curl -o /dev/null -s -w "Time: %{time_total}s\n" \
  https://your-app.vercel.app/api/customers

# Appointment list endpoint
curl -o /dev/null -s -w "Time: %{time_total}s\n" \
  https://your-app.vercel.app/api/appointments
```

**Expected**: Response times under 500ms for list endpoints

### Migration Paths (Choose One)

See `docs/CRITICAL_FIXES_COMPLETE.md` for detailed instructions.

**Path A: Manual SQL Migration** (Recommended for Production)
```bash
# 1. Backup database
pg_dump -Fc $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).dump

# 2. Apply SQL migration
psql $DATABASE_URL < docs/migrations/critical_fixes.sql

# 3. Generate Prisma Client
pnpm prisma generate

# 4. Test thoroughly
pnpm test
pnpm rls:test
```

**Path B: Prisma Migrate Dev** (Development Only - DATA LOSS)
```bash
# WARNING: This resets the database
pnpm prisma migrate dev --name fix_production_critical_issues
```

**Path C: Prisma Migrate Deploy** (If migrations exist)
```bash
# Apply pending migrations
pnpm prisma migrate deploy
```

### Production Deployment Steps

```bash
# 1. Ensure all tests pass locally
pnpm test
pnpm rls:test

# 2. Update Vercel environment variables
# - DATABASE_URL (Supabase pooled connection)
# - DIRECT_URL (Supabase direct connection)
# - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
# - Other required env vars

# 3. Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# 4. Verify deployment
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health

# 5. Monitor for issues
# - Check Vercel logs
# - Check Supabase logs
# - Monitor Sentry for errors
# - Test critical user flows
```

---

## Emergency Rollback Plan

If critical issues occur after deployment:

### Scenario 1: Application Errors (Schema Mismatch)

```bash
# 1. Immediately revert the deployment in Vercel
# Go to Vercel dashboard → Deployments → Redeploy previous version

# 2. Or revert via CLI
vercel rollback

# 3. If needed, regenerate Prisma Client from previous schema
git checkout HEAD~1 prisma/schema.prisma
pnpm prisma generate

# 4. Investigate the issue
# - Check Vercel deployment logs
# - Check Sentry error reports
# - Review what changed
```

### Scenario 2: Database Issues (Bad Migration)

```bash
# 1. Stop accepting traffic (if possible)
# - Scale down Vercel deployment to 0 instances (Enterprise)
# - Or use maintenance page

# 2. Restore database from backup (if serious data corruption)
pg_restore -d your_db -c backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.dump

# 3. Revert schema and migration
git checkout HEAD~1 prisma/schema.prisma
git checkout HEAD~1 prisma/migrations/

# 4. Regenerate Prisma Client
pnpm prisma generate

# 5. Redeploy with reverted code
git commit -am "Rollback schema changes"
git push
vercel --prod

# 6. Investigate root cause
# - Review migration SQL
# - Check Supabase logs
# - Test in development environment
```

### Scenario 3: RLS Issues (Access Problems)

```bash
# 1. Verify RLS is the issue
# Check Supabase logs for "policy violation" errors

# 2. Temporarily disable RLS on affected table (EMERGENCY ONLY)
# In Supabase SQL Editor:
ALTER TABLE "YourTable" DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

# 3. Fix the RLS policy
# Review and update the specific policy causing issues

# 4. Re-enable RLS
ALTER TABLE "YourTable" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

# 5. Test thoroughly before considering it fixed
```

### Post-Rollback Actions

- [ ] Document what went wrong
- [ ] Identify root cause
- [ ] Create reproduction steps
- [ ] Test fix in development
- [ ] Update deployment checklist
- [ ] Schedule new deployment attempt

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics to Watch Post-Deployment

**Application Health:**
- Response time (target: < 500ms for API routes)
- Error rate (target: < 0.1%)
- 5xx errors (target: 0)

**Database Health:**
- Connection pool usage (target: < 80%)
- Slow queries (target: < 100ms average)
- RLS policy violations (target: 0 unexpected violations)

**User Experience:**
- Page load time (target: < 2s)
- Failed logins (should remain at baseline)
- Failed operations (should remain at baseline)

### Where to Monitor

1. **Vercel Dashboard**: Deployment logs, function logs, analytics
2. **Supabase Dashboard**: Database metrics, slow queries, RLS violations
3. **Sentry**: Error tracking and performance monitoring
4. **Upstash**: Rate limiting metrics (if using)
