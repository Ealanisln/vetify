# Onboarding Flow Implementation Tracker

This document explains how to use the comprehensive implementation tracking system for the multi-step onboarding flow with trial management.

## 🎯 Overview

The implementation tracker helps monitor progress across all phases of the onboarding flow implementation, from database setup to production deployment.

## 📊 Tracking Components

### 1. Todo List System
- **Location**: Built-in todo system
- **Purpose**: Track individual tasks with status updates
- **Features**: Task status, priorities, dependencies, progress tracking

### 2. Implementation Dashboard
- **Location**: `/admin/implementation`
- **Purpose**: Visual dashboard for overall progress
- **Features**: Phase overview, detailed tracking, next steps

### 3. Progress Components
- **Files**: 
  - `src/components/onboarding/OnboardingImplementationTracker.tsx`
  - `src/components/admin/OnboardingImplementationDashboard.tsx`
  - `src/components/onboarding/ImplementationProgress.tsx`

### 4. Status Checker Script
- **File**: `scripts/update-implementation-status.mjs`
- **Usage**: `pnpm implementation:check`
- **Purpose**: Automated status checking and reporting

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Check Current Status
```bash
# Run the implementation status checker
pnpm implementation:check

# View the dashboard (after starting the dev server)
pnpm dev
# Navigate to http://localhost:3000/admin/implementation
```

### Update Task Status
1. **Via Todo System**: Use the built-in todo commands to update task status
2. **Via Dashboard**: Use the implementation dashboard interface
3. **Manual Verification**: Run the status checker script

## 📋 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Database & Core Setup
- [ ] Run `scripts/create-b2b-plans.sql` to seed plans
- [ ] Add trial and billing fields to Tenant/TenantSubscription models  
- [ ] Update Prisma migrations for trial support
- [ ] Create trial management and billing utilities
- [ ] Test plan queries and trial calculations

### Phase 2: Trial Onboarding (No Stripe)
- [x] Create multi-step onboarding components
- [x] Implement plan selection UI with billing clarifications
- [x] Add progress indicator and confirmation with billing messaging
- [ ] Update `createTenantWithDefaults` to skip Stripe completely
- [ ] Test complete onboarding flow without payment

### Phase 3: Trial Management System
- [ ] Create trial status checking API
- [ ] Implement dashboard trial banner with billing status
- [ ] Build notification system for users without payment method
- [ ] Create automated cleanup script
- [ ] Test notification timing and billing messaging

### Phase 4: Immediate Billing Conversion System
- [ ] Build payment method collection UI with billing start messaging
- [ ] Create Stripe integration for immediate billing (no trial)
- [ ] Implement subscription upgrade API with billing date calculation
- [ ] Add subscription management pages
- [ ] Test immediate billing start and next billing date calculation

### Phase 5: Monitoring & Analytics
- [ ] Add trial conversion tracking with billing metrics
- [ ] Create trial metrics dashboard
- [ ] Set up automated trial management cron jobs
- [ ] Monitor trial-to-paid conversion rates and billing success
- [ ] Implement customer success alerts for billing issues

### Phase 6: Deployment & Testing
- [ ] Deploy trial management system
- [ ] Run plan seeding in production
- [ ] Test end-to-end trial flow with immediate billing
- [ ] Monitor for errors, conversion rates, and billing issues
- [ ] Optimize based on user behavior and billing patterns

## 🔧 Key Implementation Files

### API Endpoints
- `src/app/api/onboarding/route.ts` - ✅ Main onboarding endpoint
- `src/app/api/onboarding/plans/route.ts` - ✅ Available plans
- `src/app/api/subscription/status/route.ts` - ❌ Trial status (TO BE CREATED)
- `src/app/api/subscription/upgrade/route.ts` - ❌ Trial conversion (TO BE CREATED)

### Components
- `src/components/onboarding/OnboardingForm.tsx` - ✅ Multi-step form
- `src/components/onboarding/OnboardingProgress.tsx` - ✅ Progress indicator
- `src/app/onboarding/steps/PlanSelection.tsx` - ❌ Plan selection (TO BE CREATED)
- `src/components/subscription/TrialBanner.tsx` - ❌ Trial banner (TO BE CREATED)
- `src/components/subscription/TrialUpgrade.tsx` - ❌ Upgrade UI (TO BE CREATED)

### Utilities & Config
- `src/lib/tenant.ts` - ✅ Tenant creation logic (NEEDS UPDATE)
- `src/lib/trial-management.ts` - ❌ Trial utilities (TO BE CREATED)
- `src/lib/billing-utils.ts` - ❌ Billing calculations (TO BE CREATED)
- `src/types/onboarding.ts` - ✅ Type definitions

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] User can select from available B2B plans during onboarding
- [ ] Plans are properly seeded in the database before deployment
- [ ] All new tenants start with a 30-day trial period without requiring credit card
- [ ] **No trial period in Stripe - billing starts immediately when payment method is added**
- [ ] **Clear messaging about when first charge will occur**
- [ ] Smooth transition between onboarding steps with proper state management
- [ ] Trial conversion system with immediate Stripe billing upon payment method addition
- [ ] Trial notification system to encourage conversion
- [ ] Dashboard trial status indicators and upgrade prompts

## 🔑 Key Decisions

1. **Trial Period**: All plans get 30 days free
2. **Default Plan**: PROFESIONAL is the entry-level B2B plan
3. **No Free Plan**: B2B model doesn't include a free tier
4. **Billing Interval**: Users choose monthly/yearly during onboarding
5. **🆕 Stripe Trial**: NO trial period in Stripe - billing starts when payment method is added
6. **🆕 First Charge**: Calculated from payment method addition date, not original trial start
7. **🆕 Trial Continuation**: App trial continues until original end date even after billing starts
8. **🆕 Clear Communication**: Users understand exactly when billing begins

## 📊 Monitoring & Metrics

Track these key metrics:
- Trial signup rate
- Trial-to-paid conversion rate
- Time to conversion
- Payment method success rate
- Billing health score
- Customer satisfaction during onboarding

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Plans not found error**: Run B2B plans migration
2. **Database schema issues**: Check Prisma migrations
3. **Stripe integration errors**: Verify API keys and webhook setup
4. **Trial calculations incorrect**: Review billing utilities

### Getting Help
1. Check the implementation status: `pnpm implementation:check`
2. Review the detailed tracker in the admin dashboard
3. Consult the original implementation document: `docs/pending-fixes/onboarding-flow.md`
