# Merge Conflict Resolution for PR #22

## The Conflict

**File:** `src/app/dashboard/appointments/new/NewAppointmentClient.tsx`

**Type:** `add/add` conflict (file exists in both branches with different content)

---

## What's Different?

### Main Branch (Older Version)
```typescript
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
// Missing useSearchParams and useMemo
```

### Development Branch (Enhanced Version) âœ…
```typescript
import { useRouter, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation';
import { useMemo } from 'react';

// Has URL params support for pre-filling appointment forms
// Has contextual customer name display
// More complete implementation
```

---

## Resolution: Accept Development Version âœ…

The **development version** has additional features:
- âœ… URL parameter support (`?customerId=xxx&petId=xxx`)
- âœ… Pre-fills form with customer/pet data from URL
- âœ… Shows contextual banner with customer name
- âœ… Uses `useMemo` for performance optimization

The main branch has an incomplete implementation.

## How to Resolve on GitHub

### Option 1: Use GitHub Web Editor (Easiest)

1. Go to PR page: https://github.com/Ealanisln/vetify/pull/22
2. Click **"Resolve conflicts"** button
3. GitHub will show the conflict markers:
   ```typescript
   <<<<<<< main
   import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
   =======
   import { useRouter, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation';
   import { useMemo } from 'react';
   >>>>>>> development
   ```

4. **Delete the main branch version** and keep development:
   - Remove the `<<<<<<< main` line
   - Remove the main branch imports
   - Remove the `=======` line
   - Remove the `>>>>>>> development` line
   - Keep ONLY the development branch code

5. Click **"Mark as resolved"**
6. Click **"Commit merge"**
7. PR is ready to merge! ðŸŽ‰

### Option 2: Command Line (Alternative)

```bash
# From your local machine
cd /Users/ealanis/Development/current-projects/vetify

# Checkout main and merge development
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge origin/development

# When conflict appears, accept development version
git checkout --theirs src/app/dashboard/appointments/new/NewAppointmentClient.tsx

# Stage and commit
git add src/app/dashboard/appointments/new/NewAppointmentClient.tsx
git commit -m "Merge development into main - resolve NewAppointmentClient conflict

Accept enhanced version from development with URL params support"

# Push to main
git push origin main
```

---

## Why This Conflict Happened

Both branches added the same file independently:
- **Main branch:** Someone created a basic version
- **Development branch:** Enhanced version was developed in parallel
- **Result:** Git sees two different files at the same path â†’ conflict!

## Verification After Merge

After resolving and merging:

1. **Check the file exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -la src/app/dashboard/appointments/new/NewAppointmentClient.tsx
   ```

2. **Verify it has the enhanced features:**
   ```bash
   grep "useSearchParams" src/app/dashboard/appointments/new/NewAppointmentClient.tsx
   grep "useMemo" src/app/dashboard/appointments/new/NewAppointmentClient.tsx
   ```

3. **Test the functionality:**
   - Navigate to `/dashboard/appointments/new?customerId=xxx&petId=xxx`
   - Verify form pre-fills correctly
   - Verify customer name banner shows

---

## Summary

- âœ… **Conflict type:** add/add (both branches added the file)
- âœ… **Resolution:** Accept development version (has more features)
- âœ… **Method:** GitHub web editor (easiest) or command line
- âœ… **After resolution:** PR can be merged to main

The development version is clearly superior and should be the one merged into main.
