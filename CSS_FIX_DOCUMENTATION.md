# CSS Deployment Fix for Vercel

## Issue Summary
CSS styles worked perfectly in local development but failed to load on Vercel deployment. This issue persisted for approximately 1 month and affected all Vetify brand colors and styling.

## Root Cause
The Sentry Next.js wrapper (`withSentryConfig`) was interfering with CSS bundling during Vercel builds, causing styles to not be properly included in the production bundle.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Conditional Sentry Configuration
Modified `next.config.js` to conditionally apply the Sentry wrapper:
```javascript
// Only apply Sentry wrapper when NOT on Vercel
export default process.env.VERCEL
  ? nextConfig  // Plain config on Vercel
  : withSentryConfig(nextConfig, sentryWebpackPluginOptions);
```

### 2. Fallback Configuration
Created `next.config.vercel.js` as a clean configuration without any wrappers for testing purposes.

### 3. Build Verification
- Local CSS build generates 367KB bundle with all critical classes
- CSS verification script confirms all Vetify brand colors present
- All 12 critical CSS classes verified

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Deploy with Fixed Configuration (Recommended)
1. Merge the `css-debug-fix` branch to your deployment branch
2. Deploy normally to Vercel
3. The fix automatically detects Vercel environment and bypasses Sentry wrapper

### Option 2: Manual Vercel Configuration
If the automatic fix doesn't work:
1. In Vercel project settings, set build command to:
   ```
   pnpm vercel-build-clean
   ```
2. This uses the clean configuration without any wrappers

### Option 3: Environment Variable Override
Add to Vercel environment variables:
```
NEXT_CONFIG_FILE=next.config.vercel.js
```

## Verification Steps

### Local Testing
```bash
# Clean build and test
rm -rf .next
pnpm build
node scripts/css-verification.mjs
```

### Post-Deployment Verification
1. Check browser DevTools Network tab for CSS files loading
2. Verify Vetify brand colors (#8B6E5C, #7FA99B) are visible
3. Check dark mode toggle functionality
4. Verify responsive layouts work correctly

## Critical Files Modified
- `next.config.js` - Conditional Sentry wrapper
- `next.config.vercel.js` - Clean fallback configuration
- `package.json` - Added vercel-build-clean script

## Monitoring
After deployment, monitor for:
- CSS file sizes in Network tab (should be ~367KB total)
- No 404 errors for CSS resources
- Proper styling on all pages
- Dark mode functionality

## Rollback Plan
If issues persist:
1. Revert to commit `b125d227856e0f6b65885874759e2c97e4fed759` (last known working)
2. Apply only the Sentry conditional logic without other changes
3. Test incremental changes to identify specific breaking point

## Prevention
For future updates:
1. Always test production builds locally before deploying
2. Run CSS verification script as part of CI/CD
3. Be cautious with Next.js config wrappers (Sentry, analytics, etc.)
4. Keep Vercel-specific configurations separate from local configs

## Support
If CSS issues persist after applying this fix:
1. Check Vercel build logs for any CSS-related errors
2. Verify environment variables are correctly set
3. Ensure no .vercelignore file is blocking CSS files
4. Contact Vercel support with deployment ID for investigation
